# CS Learning Roadmap

This repository tracks my Python-focused CS learning roadmap as a high school senior.  
The goal is to build foundational CS skills through progressively challenging projects, culminating in portfolio-ready work.  

---

## 📌 Roadmap Overview

- **Stage 1: Foundations** – Core Python, logic, data structures, functions.  
- **Stage 2: Data & Algorithms** – Searching, sorting, file handling, modular design.  
- **Stage 3: Applied Python & Libraries** – GUI, web scraping, basic data analysis.  
- **Stage 4: Capstone-Level Projects** – OOP, larger-scale problem-solving, portfolio-ready projects.

## 🗂 Projects

| Project | Stage | Skills | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Personal Expense Tracker (CLI) | 1 | Lists, dictionaries, file I/O, functions, loops, conditionals | Planned | Basic budgeting tool |
| Text-based Adventure Game | 1 | Functions, classes (optional), conditional logic, loops, state management | Planned | Choose-your-own-adventure style |
| Contact Book with Search & Sorting | 2 | Lists, dictionaries, searching & sorting algorithms, exception handling | Planned | CLI or minimal GUI |
| Quiz Generator & Grader | 2 | File handling (JSON/CSV), loops, randomization, functions | Planned | Randomly select questions, grade responses |
| Web Scraper & Data Analyzer | 3 | Requests, BeautifulSoup, data parsing & analysis, automation | Planned | Scrape and analyze website data |
| Mini Budgeting App with GUI | 3 | Tkinter or PySimpleGUI, event-driven programming, Matplotlib, file storage | Planned | Visualize spending with charts |
| Mini Social Media Feed Simulator | 4 | Classes & objects, lists/dictionaries, file storage (JSON), optional SQLite | Planned | Users can post, like, comment, and view feeds |
| Text-based RPG with Inventory & Combat | 4 | OOP (classes, inheritance), algorithms (combat mechanics), data structures, modular design | Planned | Turn-based combat, inventory management, leveling system |

## ✅ How to Use This Repository

1. Each project will eventually have its own folder containing:
   - Python code (`.py`)  
   - Optional data files (JSON/CSV)  
   - README with project description and usage

2. **Progress Tracking:**  
   - Update the **Status** column as you move from *Planned → In Progress → Completed*.  

3. **Optional Portfolio Use:**  
   - Completed projects can be showcased with screenshots, explanations, and GitHub Pages or Flask for web projects.

## 📚 Notes & Learning Approach

- Learn foundational Python topics first (syntax, data structures, loops, functions, OOP).  
- Attempt projects **without AI assistance**, relying solely on your knowledge and problem-solving skills.  
- Break each project into smaller modules/functions before coding.  
- Document what you learned and challenges faced for reflection and skill tracking.  
- Focus on **building problem-solving skills**, not just writing working code.
